# uchikoma-bot

Created for the community **[Stones in The Shell](https://sits-go.org/)**.

Notify starting and finished games of a specific OGS's group.

To run it, you'll need to provide your own bot token, to be pulled from your shell's environment variables (`BOT_TOKEN`).

TODO:
  - display either games with at least one group's player involved or those where the two are involved. (create command)
  - deal with suspended game (since a long time)
